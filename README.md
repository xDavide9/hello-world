# hello-world

Hi, my name is @xDavide9,

I'm a beginner programmer and I'm very passionate about coding cause it allows
to create basically whatever you can think of on the internet.

I currently know a little of Java, Python, HTML, CSS but I'm also learning C,
C++, Javascript and Kotlin. These are defenitely a lot of languages to concentrate on but I 
believe I have to seek what I want to create for me and for people on the internet
and therefore explore different options. At some point I will probably just
stick to a couple of them.

I will be starting to post what I create here (as a personal repository of projects
I guess, even though some people might want to use them too).

If you want to chat with me I'm usually found on discord at *xDavide9#6564* or you can contact
me through my website I yet have to create.
